What to do more:

maybe put in views the getFromUrl function? or somewhere to be more global because I need it in more than one js file in views 
maybe more css styling
add a dropdown list for numbers of items per page
error handle - if there are empty fields in edit or add. If there is no change in edit...
change in ES6

Maybe in the future - I am sick and I cannot think about this for now :(
